Modern web services (websites, APIs, etc.) need to be built to be scalable, reliable, cost-effective, and a billion other things.

To ensure you've covered everything, you need to take a lot of things into account when building your Web Service.

Here's a checklist of things I've compiled:

## Web Service Checklist

- 

## Development Team Checklist

- Definition of Done
- Definition of Ready
- Defined development process
- Roadmap
- Clear Backlog
- Backlog refinement process

---

That's all - though I'll probably add to it with time.

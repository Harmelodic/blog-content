Last year I did a [retrospective](/post/1514752200000) instead of New Year's Resolutions.

I'm going to do another:

## Liked

- Croatia
- Seeing my brothers over Xmas
- All fun work I did at Capgemini this year (Kubernetes and Hackathon)
- Flavour 101

## Learned

- DO THINGS (turning 23 was a kick up the bum)
- Tech Talks are super fun and boost my profile and reputation in the way I want it to.
- CyberChef is lovely.

## Lacked

- Time for non-work, non-project things.

## Longed For

- Local Physical Friendships...again.
- Fitness...again.
- More gigs...again.
- Making music

**Cap**'s ending was good, though I want to know where the hammer went.

**Tony**'s death was a good ending for him and the final click was cheesy but fitting.

MCU fucked up by not giving **Black Window** her own movie or just more character development.

**Hulk**'s character development was nice, though they've ruined him.

**Thor** was fucking amazing. Best character.

**Hawkeye** and the whole Barton family thing was really quite nice.

**Scarlet Witch** has a LOT more power than she used in the film. I feel like she should have been the one to kill Thanos, considering she had to watch Vision die twice in Infinity War.

**War Machine** did nothing except make some amusing quips, oh wait: That's his character.

**Falcon** did nothing and it's nice that he's got the shield and in the comics he becomes the next Captain America but MCU haven't done anything to show that he EARNED it, other than being Steve's friend, which isn't good enough.

**Spider-Man** did exactly what he needed to do for this film: talk to Tony and be his panicky-"WHOA! MR. STARK!"-self to make Tony happy before Tony clicked his fingers. He's got a new movie coming up and so didn't really need any more screen time.

**Rocket** was...kinda shit.

**Captain Marvel** was awesome and all of her "the rest of the universe needs saving too" shtick was well grafted to prevent her from being too involved whilst keeping her involved enough, especially in the final battle. Also, that haircut...oof, love you Carol ðŸ‘Œ

**Nebula**'s story line could have been cut and the film would have been a more palatable length whilst losing nothing. We know her and her sister used to be enemies and now are friends. All she needed to do was provide enough information to Thanos to time travel, everything more was just a lengthy attempt at making that story work.

**Ant-Man** was perfect. Not just because Paul Rudd is perfect, but because his character was done perfectly. I love him.

**Pepper** did nothing, but didn't need to do anything.

**Dr. Strange** was...useful.

**Everyone else** was just kinda...there (or not there, if they they'd been killed in the Decimation).

The final "Assemble" was cool and the music was awesome.

Overall: Decent and a nice wrap up. If someone, like me, is really immersed in the MCU, then it was a good movie. For everyone else, it was probably a little much, which I guess is why they tried to spread it out a little and not make it so intense, resulting in the 3+ hour runtime.

It's currently at #95 on my [Film's I've Seen](/list/1532228220000) list, below Infinity War and above Incredibles 2.

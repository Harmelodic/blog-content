Twitch recently released a video (insert link) on a new feature they've been developing where you can buy games on Twitch.

Okay, so here's the transcription:  
(Insert transcription)

Let's talk about why this is a bad thing (in my opinion):

Bad for you (creators will play bad games and recommend them just so they get the 5% cut)  
Bad for developers (developers lose out on 5% of their games profit and seeing as Twitch seem to be partnering with AAA game studios, this also drives the games market away from indie games (which is where the interesting GOOD stuff is right now))  
Microtransactions (insert big rant about them being shit because THEY ARE. Also insert more talk about how creators will advertise the microtransactions in games and will advertise the microtransaction-filled games more because they get that tasty 5% cut)  

(Insert pretentious logical conclusion of why this is bad and why many places will say “this is so handy”.  
Also give credit that this is a pretty good business move for twitch, creators and advertisers but then follow up with a final conclusion on how business and money is killing the game industry)

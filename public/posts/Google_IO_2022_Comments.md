# Google IO notes

## Translate

> 24 new languages in Google Translate

Cool.

## Maps

> 5x number of buildings in Africa since July 2020

> Dataset in Africa is publicly available

Good.

> Immersive view in Google Maps: like 3D view but even more accurate, neat!

## Eco-friendly

> Eco-friendly routes expanding to Europe

> Flights has carbon emission information

Good. But still a little pushing on the "individual-choice" for environmental improvement when really it's just a bunch of companies.

## YouTube

> Auto-generated chapters on YouTube is expanding and becoming more accurate

> Transcribing videos too

I guess that stuff is good.

## Google Workspace

> Automated Summarisation: Automatic TL;DR in Google Docs and Google Chat

Yeah but you should probably not work in a way where you NEED a TL;DR.

Either the document is important enough to read, or you need to condense stuff and write better.

> Google Meet video improvements: Studio lighting and camera processing improvements

Nice.

## Search

> Multisearch with Google Lens & Text Search and "Multisearch, near me" for location-based results

> Google Lens overlays

Cooooooooooool.

## Diversity & Inclusion

> Monk Skin Tone Scale

> Open-source at skintone.google

Personally think this is really good, but as a white guy, I don't really have that authority to make that judgement.

## Google Assistant / Home Automation

> Look and Talk

All on-device == good. Still spooky. Also looked really fuckin' robotic and unnatural.

> Quick Phrases

Look really cool, but always listening

> Umms and pauses are actually taken into account

Pretty cool!

## LaMDA 2

Why are so many things called some variation on "Lambda".  
Java, JavaScript, AWS Serverless, Google's Conversation Language

> Having a conversation with your technology feels a bit... dystopian. Just talk to people and use the internet for information.

> Talking to a computer like you would with a human

> Feedback for ethics.

Ehhhhhhh, just talk to people? Replace jobs with tech. Don't replace people with tech.

## Chain of thought prompting / PaLM (Pathways Language Model)

> Improving ML learning in Questions and Answers.

OK.

## Google Datacentres

> New one and high percentage of Carbon-free energy.

Neat.

## Google Computing Security & Privacy

Doing more with:

> Threat Modelling

> Project Zero

> Google Shield

> Phishing protections in Google Docs, Sheets, Slides

> Push for "Passkey"

> Virtual Cards in Google Pay

> Protected Computing

Still built on the idea that they have your data.
Your data would be more secure and private if it just... wasn't collected.

## Data

> Never sell data

Yeah, but you sell advertising space based on your data collection, which is selling data by proxy.

> Don't use race, sexual orientation to personalise ads.

> Ads Center as a new product for Consumers

> Remove results from Google search for bits of your personal data.

Mmmmm white-washing the problems that Google actually has with data-collection and privacy.

## Android 13

> More updates to Material You

> RCS messaging and a poke at Apple for not supporting it.

> Phone and Wallet

> The New Google Wallet, with storing tickets, passes and IDs

> Alerts for accidents and earthquakes

Cool stuff.

## Android on Tablets

> Notification shade is much more efficient

> Task bar is much more functional for multitasking

> Multitasking in with dual screen and drag and drop is much nicer

> 20+ Google Apps are getting updated with these design updates

Very cool stuff.

## Multi-device usage

> Casting works more places and better

> "Phone Hub" on ChromeOS for messaging from your laptop

> Pushing the Matter standard for interoperability

Neat.

Still not sold on Matter. I want interoperability but I want everything to just run locally.

## Pixel 6a

> Mentions of 6, 6 Pro and Tensor chip

> 6a

> No bump

Very cool, but no back fingerprint sensor ???

> With Tensor chip

> Same colour options as 6

> All the software cool things of 6

> July 21st or in-store on 28th

Aight.

## Pixel 7 and 7 pro

> Coming in Autumn

> Fancy backs

> Still the big camera bumps

> Very simple, minimalistic design

> Use NEXT generation of Google Tensor chips

> Both will come with Android 13

Okay.

## Pixel Buds Pro

> Google competitor to Apple's AirPods Pro.

> Basically a similar feature set but with a more Pixel Buds design language.

> Spatial Audio coming later this year

> Find My Device support

> 4 colours

> $199

Actually not a fan, cause they look a bit chunky than the normal flush Pixel Buds

## Google Pixel Watch

> Very clean circular design.

> Coming in Autumn.

> Twist attachment for bands

> Looks like it has most of the normal smart watch features are there, with Google Home integration.

> No price indication

Aight. Not really a smartwatch guy. But maybe.

## Pixel Tablet

> Some design renders, but hey they're working on something

> Coming 2023

Cool to hear, and if I was a Android developer for Tablets, then it'd be interesting.

## New phyiscal Google Stores

Are a thing.

## New Google Glasses

> Subtitles for translation when talking.

Looks really cool, but want to see it for myself.

At my work (I'm a Software Engineer for those who aren't aware), we use this way of working called Scrum, where we essentially perform work in 2 week sprints and at the end of the 2 weeks we have a [Retrospective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29#Sprint_review_and_retrospective).

The way we do our retrospective is in 4 parts:

- Liked
- Learned
- Lacked
- Longed For

So, with everyone doing reviews of 2017 and doing their 2018 New Year's resolutions, I figured I'd do my own version which combines it all; and put it in the format of a retrospective.

So, here we go!

## Liked

- _Films_.  
GOOD LORD, there have been some fucking good movies come out this year. I'm not going to list all of them, but some of my favourites have been:
    - Baby Driver
    - Baby Driver
    - Blade Runner 2049
    - Spiderman: Homecoming
    - Star Wars: The Last Jedi
    - Dunkirk
    - Thor: Ragnarok

- _TV_.  
I've also watched some fantastic TV this year! I know it's not a 2017 show but I started watching _Always Sunny in Philadelphia_ this year and that is fucking exceptional. _Stranger Things_ Season 2 was also fantastic.

- _Friends_.  
This year I've met up with friends (and made some new ones too), including but not limited to:
    - The stunning Danielle ["BruellaDeville"](https://twitter.com/BruellaDeville) Partis

    - The hilarious Owen ["ThePerkyRiolu" "Perky"](https://twitter.com/ThePerkyRiolu) Trett

    - The extravagant Harry ["HarryIsLate" "TechShark" "ItsTechShark" "TechTheShark"](https://twitter.com/HarryIsLate) Mitchell

    - Famous filmmaker extraordinaire Alex ["Kosky101" "Kosky"](https://twitter.com/Kosky101) Kosky

    - The never-aging Amy ["LikeTotallyAmy"](https://twitter.com/LikeTotallyAmy) Walton

    - The glorious Dan ["RichQuartz"](https://twitter.com/Rich_Quartz) Riches.

- _Travelling_.  
I've done a lot of travelling this year:
    - Insomnia61 with friends
    - London shenanigans with friends
    - Edinburgh for last New Year with friends
    - Going to Paris for my 22nd birthday with my brother and his girlfriend
    - Edinburgh this December with family
    - Northumberland in the summer with family

- _Piano_.  
Buying a piano was an excellent idea. Not only has it increased my love for piano and jazz, it's also helped me mentally, as it allows me to focus and bring happiness to myself as I learn and write new songs.

- _Moving into the city centre_.  
I was fucking miserable in my last apartment. It had far too much space for 1 person, not close enough to the city centre and held a lot of rough memories within it. I needed to move and wanted to move closer to the city centre, so I did. It's been wonderful for my mental health and given me a wonderful confidence in socialising as I know I have a nice, cosy, welcoming home to come back to if I ever get too nervous when out and about.

## Learned

- _Casual sex is really fun_.  
I've been in and out of relationships since I was around 10 or 11 years old and I don't think I've spent more than 4 months of my life single in one time.  
In 2017, I was never in a relationship. My last one ended towards then end of 2016 and since then I've had casual sex and meetups and found it _really_ fun, tension relieving and inexpensive (being in relationships is pricey).

- _Meeting people is easier than you think_.  
I've had a lot of social anxiety since I was around 14, mainly due to bullying and loneliness, and as such have found it extremely difficult to find the will power and confidence to go out and meet people. However, in 2017, I've met up with new friends and made friends with strangers in bars and coffee shops and it's been surprisingly easy to chat to people.  
The key? Find common ground and keep fucking talking.

- _You can get over her_.  
A long while ago, I was in a long relationship with a girl. Since then, I've thought about her and what we could have been and hated myself for not making it work or doing better in our relationship. She was, and is, open-minded, philosophical, a feminist, an activist, and generally a wonderful human being who made me a better man and taught me how to better myself (in the non-narcissistic way) and, most importantly, help and stand up for others.  
Breaking up with her was horrific for me.    
This year, I got over her.  
We are still amicable friends and I wish her well.

## Lacked

Honestly and brilliantly, this is a fabulously short section!

- _More time at home in Manchester, ideally socialising_.  
This is honestly a tough one to fix, due to the nature of my job. I love travelling in general but regular socialising with friends (i.e. not just going to events or meetups which are few and far between) is a fucking nightmare with the amount of travelling that I have to do for work. So when I _am_ home in Manchester, I tend to sleep and do house chores and waste time browsing shit on the internet.  
I'm not really sure how to amend this, but I think the first step is to join a club or social group that meet up on a day when I'm actually in Manchester (like a weekend or something).

## Longed For

Ah...the, what is effectively, New Year's resolutions section!

- _Get under 80kg AND/OR get to a good state of physical fitness, before I'm 23_.  
For too long have I been dancing above the "Healthy" weight BMI status and I'm going to be frank with you reader, I'm fucking fed up with it. I've looked in the mirror several times this year and seen a tired, unattractive man staring back at me. That needs to change and so I'm doing something about it. I've got a workout schedule organised; I've already been eating better for the past couple of months, so that needs to continue.  
I turn 23 at the start of April. By then, I want to be happier with my own image and not get exhausted when climbing the stairs up to my apartment.

- _More overseas travelling_.  
This year, I spent a large amount of my annual leave on Christmas holidays and only went abroad once. I'm only going to be young once and I have a bunch of friends who live Europe, so why not go visit them and enjoy their country's culture whilst I still can (#BrexitIsComing).

- _More gigs_.  
This year I did a good stint of events but didn't really go to any gigs. I adore music and enjoy going to concerts and festivals, so why don't I do more? Well...I'm going to. I've already got 2 gigs planned (and tickets bought) for March and I hope I go to a couple more later in the year.

- _Regular **physical** friendship connections_.  
No offence to many of you reading this, but I only really have friends that I talk to over the internet. That is _perfectly_ socially acceptable nowadays and I love you all, but socialising with friends over the internet lacks the physical connection that I really want from friendship. This has been counteracted this year by meeting up with people at events and occasionally meeting up with strangers in bars or from Tinder, but good GOD that is not nearly enough for my socially starved self. There have been times this year where I've gone _weeks_ without meeting anyone outside of work. It's been fucking awful for my mental health and so it needs to change.  
As I mentioned before, I'm going to try to join a meetup/social club that meet up regularly or just do more hobbies that might lead me to making more physical friendship connections.

## Round up

And with that, I wish you all a Happy New Year and hope that you have a wonderful 2018.

Love,

Harmelodic x

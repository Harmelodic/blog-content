A couple of months ago, I got a new job as an Engineering Manager for Klarna.

This involved me moving to Stockholm, Sweden.

I've been here about a month.

Here are my thoughts.

## Washing machine & dryer in the bathroom

It is the room for cleaning, and these are the cleaning machines. It did make me think: Why does Britain put these appliances in the kitchen - The food preparation room. I don't want lint and microfibres in my food.

## Open Apartment Design

Similar to other parts of Europe, the apartment design/layout in Sweden is very Open plan. Everything feels airy and open instead of being cramped and dark. Pretty nice.

## Wide Roads

Very wide roads, with wide cycle paths and pavements. Like...it's so lovely being able to walk along a path near the curb and not be 30 centimetres from a truck speeding past.

## Clean Streets

Fuck me, it's clean here. Chewing gum covered streets? Nope. Rubbish by the curbs? Nope. Cigarette butts everywhere? Well...that's still a thing because the Swedes like to smoke, but it's not actually that bad.

People seem to just care about making their country/city/street a pleasant place to be - because why wouldn't you?!

## Nice Drivers

They're not shouting at me, and they're not pestering me to move. They'll just wait and carry on when it's their right of way.

## Pleasant Crossings

UK crossings sound like "BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-".  
Stockholm crossings sound like "psh-psh-psh".

It's nice to not be shouted at to cross by a high-pitched beeping sound, and instead be notified that it's time to walk by a gentle psh-ing noise.

Also, the crossing button isn't covered in chewing gum or has a smashed up button.

## There's no rush

London, Birmingham, Manchester - most of British people are eager to get somewhere. There's a tension in the air in Britain that you can almost feel - it's exciting at first, but ultimately just stressful.

The Swedes, on the other hand, just seem to be pretty relaxed. They'll be on time, but there's no need to panic or rush. If we've got time, we'll stop at a restaurant and grab some lunch or something. Everything is just much more relaxed. 

## Government-run services actually...work.

Turns out that if you fund government services properly, things actually work!  
(Fuck you, UK Tories)

SL, Skatteverket, Systembolaget.

All of the above are government run services, that *actually* work.

SL or Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (Stockholm city public transport), is the organisation that runs all public transport in Stockholm. Transport is fast, on time and there's LOTS of services to LOTS of places.

Skatteverket is the Swedish Tax Authorities. The equivalent of HMRC. There's a Skatteverkey office in Stockholm - I popped along the other day, got in a queue, waited for around 10-15 minutes and got to speak to someone about applying for my personnummer (ID number).
Took about 20 minutes in total and I felt helped and the process was smooth.

Systembolaget are the alcohol shops. They look and feel like M&S stores. The range of wines and beers are good, though there are no crates or anything if you want to just grab a crate of beers.

## Cashless - Contactless, Swish & BankID

In Sweden, a lot of systems that you log into, you don't log into with a username & password. Instead you log in with BankID.

BankID is an authentication system made by a bunch of banks (and the Bank of Sweden, I believe (the national bank)). You basically get an app on your phone called BankID and it connects to your bank account, and then you log into other apps and services via getting BankID codes from your BankID app.
It's super simple and super easy.

Another service made by a bunch of banks, is Swish. Swish is a payment/bank transfer app. As long as you know the phone number of someone, and they have Swish, you can send them money. You can even generate a unique QR code and people can scan it and just send money. It's super easy, super simple to use and the perfect way to easily pay your mates for a meal, or pay at a small business/shop.

## On the go lunch? Nope, let's sit and eat.

Want to pop to Tesco to pick up a quick sandwich, drink and snack? Too bad, not only is there no Tesco, but meal-deal-styled lunches aren't really a thing.

Instead, people just go out and eat at a local restaurant.

## Alcohol isn't a big thing

...and honestly, I don't miss it that much.

_looks across the room at the wine cooler in my apartment_

Hm.

## Supermarkets are f a n c y

Put simply, the "cheap" standard supermarket here is a store called ICA.

It's the Tesco of Stockholm.

Once inside though, the modern design, layout and quality of food is more akin to M&S, Waitrose or Booths.

## Personnummer

The bane of an expat - but when you stop and think about it: It's a really neat thing.

It's basically your ID number, like the British National Insurance Number or the USA's Social Security number.

As long as you have a personnummer you can go to a bank and open an account, you can use your ID card with it on as ID for buying alcohol, you use it to pay taxes, you use it to link your identity for pretty much any business account.

## High taxes? Yeah but... free stuff.

Sure, I pay a lot in taxes but that provides:

- Completely free education, even to expats
- Mostly free healthcare
- Clean streets
- Well-run government systems

## Svenska är svårt

(Swedish is difficult)

## $$$ (kr kr kr)

It's expensive here.

Some stuff is similarly priced to the UK, and some stuff (like some groceries) are cheaper than the UK, but in general:

Things are 2x the price than the UK - but then again: I'm being paid quite a bit more than I was in the UK.

and that is what it is like in Sweden, after a month.
